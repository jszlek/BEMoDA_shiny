# BEMoDA shiny v1.1.2 - BiowaivEr aid for Model Dependent-Independent Approach script for in-vitro dissolution profile comparison
# 
# Model Independent Approach script for in-vitro dissolution profile comparison as proposed by Tsong et al. in 1996
# (Tsong Y, Hammerstrom T, Sathe P, Shah VP. (1996) Statistical Assessment of Mean Differences between Two Dissolution Data Sets, Drug Info. J. 30:1105-1112).
# 
# The developed script was based on the code published at forum.bebac.at by Shuanghe (post: SAS/R code of MSD method for comparing dissolution)
